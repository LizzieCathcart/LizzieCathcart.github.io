		<p>So we headed off to San Diego for a 5 day trip to visit with the Cloyds who were having a wedding celebration for Sam and Becca. Our flight was to leave Newark at 10:30 with a layover in Chicago. Turns out, that hour layover became 6 hours!! </p>
	<hr>
	<p>We landed in San Diego safe and sound, but late (at least it felt late for us North-Easterners), and we were starving. So off we headed to the highly spoken about In and Out Burger, which turned out sharing  a parking lot 
with our hotel. Convenient and delicious!

	Someone was a bit jet lagged and acted in the way we were all feeling internally. </p>
